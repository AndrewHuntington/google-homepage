## Some things I practiced/learned:
1. How to layout a page using CSS Grid
2. How to create and manipulate forms with input fields and buttons.
3. How to change the logo in the browser's tab (although this isn't perfect...)
4. How to move and layout data on a page to get it to show up the way I want it to.
